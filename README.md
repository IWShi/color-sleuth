Color Sleuth is a two-player game in which players take turns choosing the one tile out of nine that is colored a slightly different shade than the others.
Each correct guess earns you one point. Incorrect guesses earn you zero points. There are ten rounds in total, with the differences between the shades
getting progressively smaller as you proceed. The player with the highest number of points at the end wins.
